# Yearly sales data analysed using Python's Pandas and Matplotlib library. 

## I tried to find answers to the following questions using the given data:-

**1. What was the best month for sales?**

![monthly sales](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Pandas-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Images/monthly_sales.png)

As per the above visualisation, Decebmer has the most no of sales. This could be because of Christmas and upcoming New Year and holidays.


**2. WWhich city had the highest sales?**

![sales per city](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Pandas-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Images/sales_per_city.png)

San Franscisco followed by LA and New York, pretty understandable given they are big cities with huge population.


**2. Best Time of the day to display ads?**

![best time to display ads](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Pandas-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Images/best_time_to_display_ads.png)

We can clearly see that around 11 am - 12 pm and during the day and 7 pm at the evening is the best time to display the ads given that most sales take place during those times.



**What product was sold the most? What could be the reason?**

![most sold item](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Pandas-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Images/most_sold_item_and_its_relation_with_price.png)

The triple A (AAA) battries were mostly sold followed by double A (AA) batteries. We can also clearly intrepret that the quantity is somehow inversely related to the price. 
However, there are some exceptions with items like macbook pro and iPhone which ig is pretty understandable given their demands are always high.

**What products are most often sold together?**

![sold together](https://github.com/Kaushal-Dhungel/Pandas-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Images/sold_together.png)

We can see that mostly phones followed by Charging cables or headphones are most often bought together.
